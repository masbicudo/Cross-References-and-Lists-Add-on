The Cross References and Lists Add-on for Google Docs
does not collect nor keeps any information from the end-user
in any form.

The side panel is only used as a user interface to receive commands,
as is the menu of the add-on.

Nothing is recorded except for user options, which are stored inside
the user account or the document itself, never to be sent anywhere.
