# Thanks!

Even though you didn't finish the donation, thank you for even considering!
Maybe this is not the right time for you.
We need to follow our hearts and our brains.
If you ever feel the moment has come, I will receive whatever you decide
to give with happiness, knowing that it is then the right time for both of us.

Thank you very much!
